ToolStats is a Paper plugin that display various stats about tools. This plugin is inspired off of [GearStats](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/gearstats.12960/). You can disable/enable which stats are shown on which tools via the config. Note: stats are tracked regardless of config setting. The config is to disable the lore on the item.

Here is everything it tracks:
* Blocks mined (pickaxes, shovels, axes, hoes, shears)
* Crops mined (hoes)
* Player/mob kills (swords, axes, tridents, bows/crossbows)
* Ownership of items when crafted, looted (from chests), traded, spawned via creative, and caught from fishing.
* Armor damage taken.
* Fish caught.
* Sheep sheared.
* Arrows shot (bows/crossbows)

The best part is, this data is stored on the item itself. You can also change how the lore is displayed on the items!

If item lore is ever incorrect/missing, you can run `/toolstats reset`. This command fixes the lore on whatever item you are holding.
